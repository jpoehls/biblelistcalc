# brunch-typescript

Adds TypeScript support to [brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage
Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save brunch-typescript`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"brunch-typescript": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.
  Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) TypeScript version. From version 1.7.0, this plugin requires version Brunch >=2.2.0.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"brunch-typescript": "git+ssh://git@github.com:baptistedonaux/brunch-typescript.git"`.

## brunch-config

If there is a `tsconfig.json` file present in the root of your project, the `compilerOptions` from that will be used as defaults.

Any options in your brunch-config.js/coffee will override those.

```js
exports.config = {
  plugins: {
    brunchTypescript: {
      removeComments: true
    }
  }
}
```

If no options are provided, this plugin will default to the following:

```js
{
  target: "es5",
  module: "commonjs",
  emitDecoratorMetadata: true,
  experimentalDecorators: true
}
```
